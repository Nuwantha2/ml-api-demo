## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **Linear Regression ML pipeline** using `scikit-learn`. It's a great starting point if you're getting into ML engineering or data science. The model is trained on synthetic data and saved as a reusable `.pkl` file — ready to plug into an API or any downstream application.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Generates synthetic regression data using `scikit-learn`
- 🏋️ Trains a `LinearRegression` model
- 💾 Serializes and saves the trained model as `model.pkl`
- 🔮 Ready-to-use for real-time or batch predictions
- 🧱 Clean, beginner-friendly project structure

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nuwantha2/ml-api-demo.git
cd ml-api-demo
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
# Create venv
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate — Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate — Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the script

```bash
python main.py
```

> ✅ This will train the model and generate `model.pkl` in the project root.

---

## 🔮 Making Predictions

After running `main.py`, you can load the saved model and make predictions like this:

```python
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load the saved model
with open("model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Predict on new data
X_new = np.array([[1.5], [2.3], [3.7]])
predictions = model.predict(X_new)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

## 🚀 What's Next?

Some ideas to level this project up:

- 🌐 Wrap the model in a **FastAPI** or **Flask** REST API
- 📈 Add **model evaluation metrics** (MSE, R² score)
- 📊 Visualize predictions vs actuals with **matplotlib**
- ☁️ Deploy to **Heroku**, **Render**, or **AWS Lambda**
- 🔄 Swap synthetic data for a **real-world dataset**
